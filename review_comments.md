Title: How stationary are planetary waves in the Southern Hemisphere?
Authors: Elio Campitelli, Carolina Vera, Leandro D ́ıaz
Review: The authors apply a simple quantitative measure of planetary wave stationarity to three reanalysis data sets. Their results confirm the earlier work of Van Loon and Jenne (1972) that, for the case of the SH, planetary wave 1 is highly stationary, with planetary waves 2 and 3 having only quasi-stationary characteristics.

Comments: The work is competent but far to brief. The earlier work of van Loon and Jenne (1972), to which the current manuscript is presented as a re-examination of, was far more comprehensive in terms of metrics and diagnosis. In the current manuscript, only seasonal cycle is shown at two latitudes (50S and 50N). There is no examination of the horizontal structures of the waves nor is there a direct comparison to other indices, for example the ZW3 index of Raphael (2004) or Fourier analysis such as found in the work of Turner et al (2017). Finally I find the conclusions are not particularly surprising and are even well recognised.

For these reasons I find the manuscript unsuitable for GRL. However, I do recommend the authors revise the manuscript, including expanded results, and then consider resubmission to JGR Atmosphere or similarly appropriate journal.

Minor point: Much of the conclusions are actually reference to the literature, which would be more appropriate in the introduction.

Reviewer #2 (Comments to Author (shown to authors):

The authors use the NCEP reanalysis to calculate the contribution of travelling vs. stationary waves to the overall climatology of planetary waves in the southern hemisphere.

Major points:

1) The main major point is that the authors should outline in more detail why the research question that they are investigating is relevant. The motivation for this study should be extended. While clearly today more data are available to study the research question, this is not sufficient motivation for a paper.
2) I disagree with the definition of planetary waves given on line 60. You can have waves of WN7 or 8 extending along a full latitudinal circle and those are not planetary waves (see e.g. Krishnamurti, T. N., M. Tewari, D. R. Chakraborty, J. Marengo, P. L. S. Dias, and P. Satyamurty, 1999: Downstream amplification: A possible precursor to major freeze events over southeastern Brazil. Weather and Forecasting, 14, 242-270.) It is more standard to define planetary waves based on their WN (e.g., WN1-3). Also I am not familiar with the term zonal waves for planetary waves in the "instantaneous" and would suggest to use a different name. How about climatological planetary wave and just planetary waves? And finally why are the waves referred to as quasi-stationary and not stationary?
3) The plain language summary is still quite complex and could be simplified further. Maybe also say here why what you are doing is relevant at some stage for forecasting maybe or process understanding.


Minor points:
L18 from on
L21 it is unclear what is meant exactly by the strength of the mid-latitude circulation
L40 How do the planetary waves contribute to blocking development? Could you add one more sentence?
L47 Do you not have a feedback from the higher WN waves on the climatology?
L77/78 Two key variables alpha zkw and Azkw are not properly defined.
L89 Please indicate that this is just for one wavenumber
L102 Mention the vertical levels
L112 based on monthly mean ...
L119 end and
L124 You could add that this is expected due to the wave propagability in the stratosphere https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ066i001p00083
L135 At which height?
L137 year
L146 I disagree with this statement since the reanalyses suffer from the same data constrains.
L156 a stronger response
L162 comparable mix is unclear? Do you mean of equal magnitude?
L164 greatly how much?
L164 the time mean
L171 This statement is unclear, please reformulate
