\section{Introduction}

Zonal asymmetries of extratropical circulation in the Southern
Hemisphere (hereafter called as ``planetary waves'') strongly modulate
weather systems and regional climate through latitudinal transport of
heat, humidity, and momentum (REFS), and by contributing to the
development of blocking events \citep[e.g.][]{Trenberth1985}.

In Rossby wave theory, stationary waves are those with zero frequency or
phase velocity \citep{Holton2012a}. In practice, however, most studies
have assumed the ``quasi-stationary'' nature of southern hemisphere
planetary waves based on \citet{Loon1972}. In this foundational study,
the authors analyzed data from 1957 and 1958 and found that while
extratropical waves with wavenumber 1 to 6 had comparable amplitudes in
daily fields, only wavenumbers 1 and 3 contributed significantly to the
climatological field. From that, they concluded that only waves 1 and 3
recurr consistently in the same location and thus have a significant
quasi-stationary component on top of a ``moving'' component. This was a
qualitative conclusion and to our knowledge no study has quantified the
level of stationarity of each wavenumber.

After more than four decades from the publication of \citet{Loon1972},
and considering the current availability of different global reanalysis
datasets, in this study we assess the stationarity features of planetary
waves in the southern hemisphere, and extends \citet{Loon1972}'s
methodology into a quantitative measure of planetary wave stationarity,
which we apply to both hemispheres.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Planetary waves}

We define \emph{planetary waves} as waves that extend along a full
latitude circle. \emph{Zonal waves} (ZW) are planetary waves of the
``instantaneous'' fields and \emph{quasi-stationary waves} (QS),
planetary waves of the time-mean field such that:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:ZW}
\mathrm{ZWk}(t) & = & A_\mathrm{ZWk}(t)\cos \left [ k\lambda - \alpha_\mathrm{ZWk}(t) \right ] \\ 
\overline{\mathrm{ZWk}(t)} = \mathrm{QSk} & = & A_\mathrm{QSk}\cos \left (  \mathrm{k}\lambda - \alpha_\mathrm{QSk} \right ) \label{eq:QS}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{linenomath*}

where \(\mathrm{k}\) is wavenumber, \(\lambda\) longitude, and
\(\mathrm{A_{x}}\) and \(\alpha_\mathrm{x}\), amplitude and phase,
respectively. \(\mathrm{ZWk}(t)\) depends on time, but not
\(\mathrm{QSk}\).

These definitions depend on which are the ``instantaneous fields'' and
the averaging time-scales. A dataset of 365 daily mean fields defines
365 daily zonal waves and one annual quasi-stationary wave but 12
monthly quasi-stationary waves (per level and latitude). A 30 year
dataset of monthly mean fields define 360 monthly zonal waves and one
30-year quasi-stationary wave. Monthly planetary waves are
quasi-stationary waves in one case and zonal waves in the other.

\subsection{Stationarity}

From the properties of the superposition of waves we can deduce that, in
general, the stationary phase \(\alpha_\mathrm{QSk}\) does not equal
\(\overline{\alpha_\mathrm{ZWk}}\) and the stationary amplitude
\(A_\mathrm{QSk}\) is less or equal \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZWk}}\)
\citep{Pain2005}.

We use this latter property and use the quotient between
\(A_\mathrm{QS}\) and \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\) as a measure of
quasi-stationary wave stationarity such as:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S}
\hat{S} = \frac{A_\mathrm{QS}}{\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

For a sample of \(n\) completely random waves, the expected value of
\(\hat{S}\) is \(n^{-1/2}\) because the average amplitude of the sum of
\(n\) waves with random phases and mean amplitude \(A\) is \(An^{-1/2}\)
\citep{Pain2005}. For completely stationary waves \(\hat{S} = 1\)
irrespective of sample size.

\(\hat{S}\) is used --sometimes as
\(2/\pi\arcsin \left (\hat{S} \right )\) \citep{Singer1967}-- in the
meteorological literature in the context of wind steadiness
\citep[e.g][]{Hiscox2010}. To our knowledge this is the first time it
has been applied to the study of atmospheric waves.

Equation \ref{eq:S} is equivalent to

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S2}
\hat{S} =   \frac{\sum_t A_\mathrm{ZW}(t) \cos  \left [\alpha_\mathrm{zw}(t) - \alpha_{qs} \right ]}{\sum_t A_\mathrm{ZW}(t)}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The numerator represents the sum of the zonal waves amplitudes projected
onto the direction of the quasi-stationary wave. Waves that deviate from
that direction decrease the overall stationarity in proportion to their
amplitude.

We used Equation \ref{eq:S2} to compute a timeseries of quasi-stationary
wave stationarity. We first calculated \(\alpha_{qs}\) for each month
and then, applied Equation \ref{eq:S2} with a 15-year rolling window
approximated using loess regression with degree 0.

\subsection{Data}

We use monthly geopotential fields from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis
\citep{Kalnay1996} for the period 1948 to 2017 and compute one
quasi-stationary wave for the whole period for each month, level and
wavenumber. Amplitude and phase for each wavenumber was estimated by
fitting a fourier transform for each latitude circle, level and monthly
record.

We analyzed the data using the statistical programming language R
\citep{R-base}, using data.table and metR packages
\citep{R-data.table, R-metR} to read and transform it and ggplot2
package \citep{R-ggplot2} to make the plots. The source code is
available as Figshare repository \citep{Campitelli2019-figshare}.

\caption{Seasonal cycle of amplitude of the geopotential planetary waves 1 to 3 computed as the amplitude of the mean wave ($A_\mathrm{QSk}$) and as the mean amplitude of the monthly waves ($\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW} }$).}\label{fig:rao}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rao} shows the seasonal cycle of the amplitude of
planetary waves at 50\degree S and 50\degree N using monthly fields from
the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis \citep{Kalnay1996} between 1948 and 2017. We
computed the left column (\(A_\mathrm{QS}\)) as the amplitude of the
average geopotential field for each month, level and wavenumber, and the
right column (\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\)) as the average amplitude of
the 70 individual fields.

Figure \ref{fig:rao1} shows that at 50\degree N for the three
wavenumbers \(A_\mathrm{QS}\) and \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW}}\) have a
similar seasonal cycle with similar vertical extent. In the southern
hemisphere, however, this is true only for wavenumber 1 (Figure
\ref{fig:rao2}). \(A_\mathrm{QS2}\) is much smaller than
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW2}}\) and its seasonal cycle is less defined.
\(A_\mathrm{QS3}\) has a smaller magnitude than
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW3}}\) end even though their overall structure is
similar (one relative maximum in February-March in the middle
troposphere and another in July-August that extends to the lower
stratosphere), they differ in the details. \(A_\mathrm{QS3}\) has a
local minimum in November that is absent in
\(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW3}}\). The relative contribution of each
wavenumber is also different. While \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW2}}\)
dominates over \(\overline{A_\mathrm{ZW3}}\) in the stratosphere and is
of similar magnitude in the troposphere, \(A_\mathrm{QS3}\) dominates
over \(A_\mathrm{QS2}\) throughout the year and in every level except in
the aforementioned November minimum.

}

\caption{Seasonal cycle of stationarity at 50\degree S and 50\degree N computed using Equation \ref{eq:S}}\label{fig:stationarity}
\end{figure}

These observations are quantified in Figure \ref{fig:stationarity},
which shows \(\hat{S}\) for wavenumbers 1 to 3 computed using Equation
\ref{eq:S} at 50\degree N and 50\degree S. We separate between high and
low stationarity with the ad-hoc threshold of 0.4 (black line in Figure
\ref{fig:stationarity}).

At 50\degree N planetary waves 1, 2 and 3 are highly stationary in
almost every month and level, and even more so planetary wave 1 at
50\degree S.

In the southern hemisphere, planetary wave 2 stationarity has a
semianual cycle. It reaches its maximum in April and in
August-September, plummeting to a deep minimum in June. Planetary wave 3
stationarity peaks in February and slowly decreases towards a November
deep minimum after witch increases sharply.

{\centering \includegraphics{fig/QS-ZW/s-timeseries-1} 

}

\caption{Quasi-stationary wave stationarity for wavenumbers 1 to 3}\label{fig:s-timeseries}
\end{figure}

Because we computed \(\hat{S}\) using the whole period, it represents
the mean stationarity between. Figure \ref{fig:s-timeseries} shows how
planetary wave stationarity changed for each wavenumber at each
latitude. Planetary wave stationarity remained high and constant for
wavenumbers 1 to 3 at 50\degree N and 1 at 50\degree S but wavenumbers 2
and 3 at 50\degree S show interdecadal variations.

Planetary wave 2 stationarity oscillated around 0.49 with maximums in
the 50's, 70's and 00's. Planetary wave 3 stationarity jumped from zero
to more than 0.5 in less than five years in the 50's and then oscillated
around 0.62 with a strong maximum in the late 80's. These could indicate
inhomogeneities caused by changes in the observational network --routine
satellite observations began in 1979-- but the absense of similar breaks
for wavenumbers 1 or 2 suggest they represent real changes in the
atmospheric circulation with unknown cause.

\section{Conclusions}

Using a quantitative measure of planetary wave stationarity we showed
that, in the southern hemisphere, planetary wave 1 stationarity is high
and constant throught the year and period, while waves 2 and 3 vary both
in intraseasonal and interdecadal timescales. Planetary wave 3
stationarity, in particular, increased dramatically in the 50's.

Plentary waves can be both forced by the surface and excited by internal
variability. Assuming that the later process will not result in a phase
preference, higher stationarity would be evidence of stronger forcing
or, more strictly, stronger forcing response. In the northen hemisphere,
topography and thermal contrast are the main forcings of plentary waves,
which explains their highly and not variable stationary nature. In the
southern hemisphere, only planetary wave 1 seems to be the result of
mainly surface forcings. Planetary waves 2 and 3 seem to be composed of
a comparable mix of internal variability and surface forcing.

Interanual and intradecadal variability in planetary wave stationarity
may serve to study variability in surface forcing response cause either
by the strengh of the forcing or the sensibility of mean state of the
atmosphere.

(Silvestri and Vera (2009 )

xxxx The literature on the topic is dominated by two main methodologies
that imply differnet definitions: some studies have defined planetary
waves by removing zonal averages from time-mean fields
\citep[e.g.][\citet{Quintanar1995a}, \citet{Raphael2004}]{Loon1972}
while others defined them by removing zonal averages from the
instantaneous (e.g.~daily, monthly or seasonal) fields
\citep[e.g.][\citet{Turner2017}, \citet{Irving2015}]{Rao2004}.

First, researchers should be aware of which phenomena they want to study
and use the appropriate methods. The mean amplitude of zonal waves could
be appropriate to study the vertical propagation of Rossby waves, for
example. But zonal wave amplitude could lead to misleading results if
used as the basis of local impacts studies because they are probably
more influenced by phase effects.

Secondly, comparison between results should also be made having this
issues in mind. For instance, \citet{Irving2015} compare their planetary
wave activity index with \citet{Raphael2004}'s wave 3 index and conclude
that the later cannot account for events with waves far removed from
their climatological position. However, being an index of the zonal wave
component in phase with the quasi-stationary wave, this is by design.

Although having a consistent nomenclature across papers is important, we
believe this problem can be ameliorated by researchers detailing their
definitions and methodology. This is also good for clarity and
reproducibility. Since planetary waves are generally more stationary in
the northern hemisphere, these issues are more critical for studies of
the southern hemisphere.

Thirdly, the explorations of both ZW and QS can lead to novel levels of
analysis. Here, we showed it can be used to define a metric of
stationarity of quasi-stationary waves, but other applications are also
possible. \citet{Smith2012} used the phase relationship between ZW1 and
QS1 to show that linear interference between the QS1 and ZW1 was related
to vertical wave activity transport at the tropopause.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

We speculate that the level of stationarity responds to the nature of
the forcings. Higly stationary planetary waves are explained mainly by
stationary forcings while low stationary planetary waves respond mainly
to the internal variation of the atmosphere. This suggests that in the
southern midlatitudes, wave 2 and 3 consist of forced responses mixed
with internat variability. Their annual cycle further suggests that the
mean state of the atmosphere can modulate these responses.
