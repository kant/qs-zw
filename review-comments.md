##  Reviewer 1:

> only seasonal cycle is shown at two latitudes (50S and 50N)

Changed the analysis to use the mean geopotential height between 45° and 65° following Turner et.al. 2007.

> or is there a direct comparison to other indices, for example the ZW3 index of Raphael (2004) or Fourier analysis such as found in the work of Turner et al (2017). 

Added a direct comparison to both indices. 
  


## Reviewer 2:

> I disagree with the definition of planetary waves given on line 60. You can have waves of WN7 or 8 extending along a full latitudinal circle and those are not planetary waves (see e.g. Krishnamurti, T. N., M. Tewari, D. R. Chakraborty, J. Marengo, P. L. S. Dias, and P. Satyamurty, 1999: Downstream amplification: A possible precursor to major freeze events over southeastern Brazil. Weather and Forecasting, 14, 242-270.) It is more standard to define planetary waves based on their WN (e.g., WN1-3)

Added clarification in text. 

> Also I am not familiar with the term zonal waves for planetary waves in the "instantaneous" and would suggest to use a different name. How about climatological planetary wave and just planetary waves? And finally why are the waves referred to as quasi-stationary and not stationary?

Although we agree that the naminc conventions are not ideal, both "zonal waves" and "quasi-stationary waves" are terms used in the citing literature (see for example Raphael 2004) and we don't want to invent new nomenclature. We aded a clarification. 

> 3) The plain language summary is still quite complex and could be simplified further. Maybe also say here why what you are doing is relevant at some stage for forecasting maybe or process understanding

Plain Language Summary is not required for Atmospheric Sciences Letters. Changed to a short abstract. 

>  L21 it is unclear what is meant exactly by the strength of the mid-latitude circulation

"it" refers to the forcing, not the circulation. Rephrased to make it clearer. 

> L40 How do the planetary waves contribute to blocking development? Could you add one more sentence?

Added a reference to the literature. 

> L47 Do you not have a feedback from the higher WN waves on the climatology?

Yes, there are dynamical feedbacks between scales, but the point here is that those other waves cancel out in the climatology. Reworded to make it clearer. 

> L77/78 Two key variables alpha zkw and Azkw are not properly defined.

They were defined as alpha_x where x refered to ZWk and QSk. Now they are defined explicitly.

> L89 Please indicate that this is just for one wavenumber

Added clarification and improved notation. 

>  L102 Mention the vertical levels

All available levels from NCEP have been used. I don't think it's productive to list them all. 

> L135 At which height?

At every level available (Figure 2).

>  L146 I disagree with this statement since the reanalyses suffer from the same data constrains.

Agree. The original statements was not meant to be absolute, but just a reflection that seeing similar results in different reanalysis makes the conclusions more solid. It's now amended to be even more soft. 

> L162 comparable mix is unclear? Do you mean of equal magnitude?

Yes. Clarified.

> L164 greatly how much?

Added numerical information. 

> L171 This statement is unclear, please reformulate
