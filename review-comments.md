##  Reviewer 1:

> only seasonal cycle is shown at two latitudes (50S and 50N)

Changed the analysis to use the mean geopotential height between 45° and 65° following Turner et.al. 2007.

> or is there a direct comparison to other indices, for example the ZW3 index of Raphael (2004) or Fourier analysis such as found in the work of Turner et al (2017). 

Added a direct comparison to both indices. 
  


## Reviewer 2:


> L77/78 Two key variables alpha zkw and Azkw are not properly defined.

They were defined as alpha_x where x refered to ZWk and QSk. Now they are defined explicitly.

> L89 Please indicate that this is just for one wavenumber

Added clarification and improved notation. 

>  L102 Mention the vertical levels

All available levels from NCEP have been used. I don't think it's productive to list them all. 

> L135 At which height?

At every level available (Figure 2).

>  L146 I disagree with this statement since the reanalyses suffer from the same data constrains.

Agree. The original statements was not meant to be absolute, but just a areflection that seeing similar resultas in different reanalysis makes the conclusions more solid. It's now amended to be even more soft. 

> L162 comparable mix is unclear? Do you mean of equal magnitude?

Yes. Clarified.

> L164 greatly how much?

Added numerical information. 

> L171 This statement is unclear, please reformulate

Corrected
